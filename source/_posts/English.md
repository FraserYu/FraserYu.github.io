> on second thought (经过再次思考)

> I would rather do sth(我宁愿做sth)

**JJ:** *Well, that’s part of growing up and being responsible. This experience will make you a better and more responsible person in the future. Trust me, a bachelor’s degree is worth much more than a temporary English teaching job. Plus, you don’t even know for sure if you’ll like teaching English. Anyways, you could always make learning English your hobby at night when you come home from work. Next semester at school, maybe you could take an English elective class. If you’re certain you really like teaching English, then next semester maybe you could tutor a child on the weekend and at the same time make some extra money?*

> maintain a professional attritude (保持专业的态度)

**XG：** *I have another co-worker who sits close to me, her name is Amanda. She’s always on the phone with her boyfriend talking up a storm. It’s really distracting, just like Jerry chewing his gum(没有复数形式，本身就是复数). What should I do about that? She’s a girl, is it okay to confront her about it?*
> She’s always on the phone with her boyfriend talking up a storm,It’s really distracting (她总是和她的男朋友煲电话粥。这真的很让人分心)
> talk up a storm (滔滔不绝的讲)
> confront sb (直面某人)

**JJ：** *Of course it’s okay. Just remember to stay professional and ask nicely. She probably doesn’t realize that she’s being a chatterbox. If you ask her nicely I’m sure she’ll keep her voice down.*
> She probably doesn’t realize that she’s being a chatterbox (她可能没有意识到自己一直在喋喋不休)
> keep her voice down

**XG:** *Thanks for all your advice. I have to get back to work now, wish me luck.*
**JJ:** *One last thing, Xiaogao. Just remember that the most important thing at work is getting along with your co-workers. If you have a bad relationship with them, then you will start to hate your job, or maybe your coworkers will despise(鄙视) you. A happy workplace is a healthy workplace!*

**XG：** *Got it. Okay, I gotta run. Talk to you later!*
**JJ：** *Hey, Xiaogao! You didn’t pay the bill! Waaaaiiit! Oh… forget it!*
> pay the bill (买单)
> forget it （算了吧）

#### 2016.6.20 A Fork in a Road
**XG:** *Hey, Jing Jing,why do you look so vexed?*
> vexed = annoyed (心烦意乱的)

**JJ:** *I’ve come to a fork in the road, I don’t know what to do. Can you give me some advice?*
> Come to a fork in the road = be in a position where you must make a tough decision (人生做重要决定的关口)
> give sb some advice/pointers/tips （给某人建议）

**XG：** *Sure, I’ll trymy best. What’s up?*
**JJ：** *Well, I’ve been working as an RN at an ICU unit for the past four years, but I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. It’s the same thing over and over, the night shift is really taking a toll on me. But three years ago, a teacher got me thinking, and I started to look into nursing overseas. I began to study professional English with the hopes of one day working as a nurse abroad.*
> RN (Registered Nurse) 注册护士
> ICU (Intensive Care Unit) 重症监护室
> hit a plateau = to be unable to make any more progress (到达瓶颈处)
> overcome / break out/ surmount the plateau 克服瓶颈

> take a toll on sb = If something takes its/a toll, it causes suffering, deaths, or damage

**XG：** *It sounds like a no-brainer.What’s holding you back?*
> no-brainer = requiring no thought; an easy decision (不需要费脑子的决定)
> hold sb back = make [one] hesitate （让人犹豫不决）

**JJ：** *I took a test in Singapore from the SNB and passed with flying colors. Just as I was about to make my next move, my parents and boyfriend complained that I shouldn’t go abroad to be a nurse. They’re worried that I won’t be able to adapt to the way of life and work environment over there. And once I go to work abroad, I’ll lose my job here in China. My parents don’t have really high expectations of me, they’ve never demanded that I find a super high paying job. As long as I am near their side they’ll be happy.*
> pass with flying colors (高分通过)
> have high expectations of/on sb (对某人有很高的期待)

**XG：** *Well I think that might be the problem right there. Look at what you’re saying: it will make your parents happy if you stay at the same hospital. Did they ever consider what would make you happy? If you’ve studied English so hard and are able to pass the Singapore test, why should they be worried about you not being able to adapt to life abroad?*
> I think that might be the problem right there (我觉得这可能就是问题的所在)
> be adapt to env/sth (适应...)

**JJ:** *What they don’t know is, Singapore was just my first step. My ultimate goal is to go to America to work as an RN. I’m confused about that too. Should I first use Singapore as a stepping stone and work there for a bit, or should I go directly to the United States to work?*
> ultimate goal (终极目标，最终目标)
> stepping stone (垫脚石，敲门砖)

**XG：** *That’s a tough call. Considering you’re only 27 years old, you’re still young and can do many things. If you wait any longer, you might miss your chance. I think going to Singapore first would be a good idea because you can prepare for what it feels like to work abroad. You might also learn important skills there that will help you when you go to the United States to work. I’m 32 years old. I’m preparing to start my second Master’s degree. I had to make this decision on my own.Taking a risk and coming to China was the best decision I 've ever made in my life.*
> tough call = a hard decision
> make a call = make a decision
> you never too old to learn sth new
> take a risk (冒险)

**JJ：** *Okay, I’m starting to feel better now. But what if I can’t find a job anywhere?*
**XG:** *Unless people stop becoming sick, you’ll be able to find a job as a nurse anywhere on Earth. Good luck to you!*

#### 2016.6.22 Saying Goodbye

> I got to say/ I got to tell you (老实说)
> take my hat for sb (脱帽致敬)
> I really appreciate it

**JJ:** *No problem, you know I always keep my word. Well, right now it’s only 7:00. You still have some time to kill before your plane leaves.*

> have some time to kill=有空闲时间来消磨

**XG:** *Okay, let’s go get a cup of coffee. It’s my treat. (Xiaogao saysto the coffee shop worker) Two cups of coffee please.*
> It's my treat (我请客)

> knock one’s socks off=（通常指口味或气味）非常浓烈。例如，一杯二锅头会“knock

**JJ:** *Now is not the time to get all emotional. Here, I brought you a going away gift.*
> 现在还不是催泪的时候。看，我给你带了一个告别礼物

**XG:** *A gift? Why did you do that?*
**JJ:** *It’s common for Chinese to give a gift when someone is coming or going. You didn’t know?*
**XG:** * No, I didn’t. That’s so nice of you. Can I open it?*
**JJ:** *Be my guest.*
> be my guest = of course 请便

### 英语语法
#### 定语从句
##### 定语从句相关基本概念
> 1. 定语从句的定义：用作定语的从句叫定语从句
> 2. 定语从句结构：**先行词 + 引导词 + 定语从句**
> 3. 先行词：被定语从句所修饰的名词或代词
> 4. 定语从句的位置：紧跟先行词（名词或代词）之后
> 5. 引导词：引导定语从句的词（包括关系代词和关系副词）
> + 关系代词：**that/who/whom/which/as**
> + 关系副词：**when/where/why**

##### 引导词的功能
> 1. 连接先行词和定语从句。（相当于桥梁）
> + *I like the book which I bought. *         
> 2. 在定语从句中充当一定的成分（关系代词充当主语或宾语，关系副词充当状语）。
> + *This is the man who studied with me. *（关系代词做主语）
> + *This is the man with whom I studied. * (关系代词做宾语, 将介词提前)*

##### 定语从句类型
定语从句有限制性和非限制性两种。限制性定语从句是先行词不可缺少的部分，去掉它主句意思往往不明确；非限制性定语从句是先行词的附加说明，去掉了也不会影响主句的意思，它与主句之间通常用逗号分开，以下是简单例子说明：
> + *This is the house which I bought last month* （限制性定语从句）
> + *The house, which I bought last month, is very nice* (非限定性定语从句)

(一) 限制性定语从句（主句和定语从句之间无逗号隔开）
> + *The man **who** you’re talking **to** is my friend.*
> + *The man **to whom** you’re talking is my friend.*
> + *I need a pencil  **with which** I can write a letter*
> + *I need a piece of paper **on which** I can write a letter*
> + *The man (**who/whom/that** 都可以) I talked **about** at the meeting is from Peking University. *
> + *The man **about whom** I talked at the meeting）is from Peking University.*
> + *The palace (**which/that** 都可以) I often pay a visit **to** was built in the 17th century.*
> + *The palace **to which** I often pay a visit was built in the 17th century*
>
> **总结**： 介词可以放到**关系代词之前**也可以放在**句子末尾**，放在关系代词之前是很地道的书写方式，介词只能加宾语，于是只有 **介词+which** 和 **介词+whom**两种形式， who在定语从句中既可以做主语也可以做宾语，作宾语可以与whom互换，但是如果有介词，必须要用whom， 另外paper单独指论文，一页纸要用a piece of paper, 北京大学要用Peking University，BJ University指北京的大学。

(二) 非限制性定语从句 （主句和定于从句之间有逗号分隔）
当当先行词是专有名词或物主代词和指示代词所修饰时，其后的定语从句通常是非限制性的
> + *Charles Smith, who was my former teacther, retired last year*
> + *My house, which I bought last month, has got a lovely garden*
> + *The novel, which I have reading three times, is very touching*

非限制性定语从句还能将整个主句作为先行词,对其进行修饰,这时从句谓语动词要用第三人称单数
> *He seems not to have grasped what I meant, which greatly **upsets** me* 他似乎没抓住我的意思，这使我心烦

由介词+关系代词（whom/which）引导
> + *I live in a house far away from city, **in front of which** is a big tree.*  其中far away from city 做后置定语
> + *There is an apple tree standing there at the gate, on which are many apples*

由“代词/名词+of+whom/which”或“of which/ whom +名词/代词”(先行词指人用whom,指物用which)引导。One, some, any, none,all, both, several, many, most, neither, either等词、数词、分数或百分比与of whom或of which连用。
> + *He has five children, two of whom are abroad.*  (He has five children, and two of them are abroad. 外国人不喜欢重复，所以将连词去掉并且把them换成which， 因为这里which就是指代them)
> + *We have three books, none of which is/are interesting.* (We have three books, but none of them is/are interesting 道理同上)

whose引导非限定性定语从句
> + *The house, whose window faces South, is mine*

**注意：** 关系代词**that**和关系副词**why**不能引导非限制性定语从句

##### 引导词（关系代词）that/which/who用法详解
（一） 当先行词是**物**时，关系代词(that/which)只用that的情况
> 1. 当先行词被序数词或形容词最高级修饰时，只能用that, 当然that也可以省略
> This is **the best** film **that** has been shown this year.
> This is **the first** book **that** I borrow from the library
> He is **the first** student **that/who** came to school today   (student 是人，所以可以用who)
> 2. 当先行词为两个或两个以上分别指人和物的名词时，只能用that
> He talked about **the teachers and the school that** he had visited.
> 3. 当先行词本身是all的，只能用that
> All that(what) I want to say to you is “Thank you”  (all that=what)
> Go over all that (what) we learned
> 4. 先行词为something, anything, nothing, everything, thing时, 只能用that
> I’ll tell you anything that I know.
> 5. 当先行词前有all, much, little, many, (a) few, every, some, any, no, only, the very, one of, the only, the last, the next等修饰语时
> This is one of the books **in which** I'm very interested （有介词就要用which）
> This is the only book that I read.
> He is the only one of the boys that likes playing the piano.
> 6. 当先行词在以who或which开头的特殊疑问句中时，用that引导以避免混淆．
> Who is the man that is talking with the lady?
> Which of you that know the answer can come to the front?
> 7. 当先行词是在定语从句中作表语时，用that
> He likes the girl that sheused to be.

（二）当先行词是物时，关系代词(that/which)只用which的情况
> 1. 作介宾且介词置于引导词之前时．
> The room **in which** he lives is very large.
> 2. 引导非限定性定语从句时（主，宾都用which,都不能省略）
> Football, which is a very interesting game, is played all over the world.
> The house, which I visited yesterday, is very large.
> 3. which指整个句子的内容或部分内容，引导非限定性定语从句
> He always makes fun of me, which upsets me.

（三）其他特殊情况
> 1. 先行词是these, those指人时，关系代词只用who
> Those who are playing over there are my students
> 2. 先行词是人称代词(he, she…)时，关系代词只用who
> He who doesn't reach the Great Wall is not a true man
> 3. 不定代词someone, anyone,everyone, no one, somebody, anybody, everybody作先行词时，关系代词用who
> Anybody who breaks the rules would be pubnished  (注意是breaks，Anybody在意思上指“全部”， 语法上只做第三人称单数用)
> 4. 先行词是the only one of +可数名词复数，在定语从句中作主语时，定语从句中的谓语用单数形式, 因为此时限定的是the only one **注意以下两个例句定语从句speak的形式区别**
> He is the only one of the students who(口语)/that **speaks** Japanese in our class
> He is one of the students who **speak** Japanese in our class
> 5. 当先行词是the way, 在定语从句中充当方式状语时（the way表＂以…方式／方法＂），引导词通常用that或省略，也可用in which．
> I don't like the way (that) you speak
> I don't like the way in which you speak
> 6. 关系代词或关系副词在从句中充当一个句子成分，因此要注意避免从句中句子成分的重复出现
> This isthe most beautiful place that I have visited it. (错误: it重复，that在这里已经做宾语 ）
> his isthe most beautiful place thatI have visited
> 7.  定语从句中关系代词或关系副词的选择取决于它们在从句中所充当的句子成分。如作主语和宾语用关系代词；作状语，用关系副词
> I’ll never forget the day when I went abroad myself.我永远记得我独自在国外的日子, （这里的the day 是一个抽象的概念，指一段日子）
> I’ll never forget the days that we spent together.我永远不会忘记我们一起度过的那些天/日子, (这里的the days是一个具体的概念)
> **the day (minute)等表时间的单数名词后+关系副词when**  （表抽象的一段时间）
> **the days(minutes)等表时间的复数名词后+关系代词that 、which** （表具体的一段时间）

##### 定从经典组合（介词+关系代词）十大难点
**Note:** 介词+关系代词主要看结构
（一） 介词+which在定语从句中分别作时间、地点和原因**状语**，代替相应的关系副词when,where和why，**介词+which合化 when/where/why**
> 1. I still remember the day *on which(when)* I first came to school   （我仍然记得当初来学校的那一天）
> **理解：** I came to school on the day.
> 2. The factory *in which(where)* I work is a large one. (我工作的工厂是一个大工厂)
> **理解：** factory不可能做work的宾语（工作工厂）， 是在工厂工作， I work in the factory
> 3. This is the reason *for which(why)* he was late (这就是他为什么迟到的原因)
> **理解：** reason不可能做late的宾语， be late for因为什么迟到

（二） 介词+which（指物）/ whom（指人）在定语从句中作地点状语，表示存在关系，定语从句主谓一般要倒置。 **打南边来了一个喇嘛；背上背着一个胖娃娃**
> 1. They arrived at a farm house, in front of which sat a small boy 他来到一处农舍，(农舍)前边坐着一个小男孩。
> **理解：** a small boy sat in front of the farm house（此时a small boy是主语， sat 是谓语）, 地点状语做主语之后，主谓倒装， a small boy 做sat的宾语
> 2. I saw a man,on the head of whom stood a bird.
> **理解：**  道理同上 a bird stood on the head of a man. 地点状语在前，主谓倒装

（三） 介词+ which（指物）/ whom（指人）在定语从句中作目的、方式或地点状语。这种结构中的介词一般受动词或介词后的名词所制约。**找定语从句里的动词看它应该搭配什么介词**
> 1. Could you tell me for whom you brought this coat (你能告诉我这件衣服是给谁买的吗？)
> **理解：** buy sth for sb, for whom 在此处是目的，指给某人
> 2. The man, from whom I learned the news, is an engineer. (这人是一位工程师，我是从他那里得到这消息的。)
> **理解：** learn sth from sb ，此处是方式

（四） 介词+which/whom，用于被动结构的定语从句中，作状语，说明动作的发出者。 **被动的使用是为了更加强调动作发出者的厉害**
> 1. The wolf by which the sheep was killed was shot (伤害羊的那只狼被打死了)
> **理解：** the sheep was killed by the wolf, 上面句子中的which就是表示the wolf.
> 2. The man by whom the wolf was shot was a good hunter. 打死狼的那人是个好猎手。
> **理解：** the wolf was shot by the man, 上面句子中的whom表示the man

#### 倒装句
##### 英语倒装结构的六大形式详解
（一） 否定副词位于句首时的倒装
在正式文体中，**never, seldom, rarely, little,hardly, scarcely, no sooner, no longer, nowhere** 等含有否定意义的副词若位于句首，则其后要用部分倒装：
> 1. I shall never forgive him -> Never shall I forgive him. 我永远不会宽恕他。
> 2. He seldom goes out for dinner -> Seldom does he go out for dinner. 他很少出去吃饭。
> 3. She hardly has time to listen to music -> Hardly does she have time to listen to music. 她几乎没时间听音乐。
> 4. He little realizes how important this meeting is -> Little doeshe realize how important this meeting is. 他不甚明白这个会议的重要性
> 5. We had no sooner reached the airport than the plane took off -> No sooner had we reached the airport than the plane took off. 我们刚到机场,飞机就起飞了。
>
> **注意：** in no time(立即，马上)位于句首时，其后无需用倒装语序：  In no time he worked out the problem. 他马上就算出了那道题。

(二) only+状语”位于句首时的倒装
**当一个状语受副词only的修饰且置于句首时，其后用部分倒装语序：**
> 1. Only then did he realize that he was wrong. 到那时他才意识到他错了。
> 2. Only in this way are you able to do it well. 你只有用这种方法才能把它做好。
> 3. Only when he returned home did he realize what had happened.  当他回到家里时，才知道出了什么事。

(三) so+adj. / adv.”位于句首时的倒装
**副词so后接形容词或副词位于句首时，其后用部分倒装**
> 1. The weather was so cold that we had to stay at home. -> So cold was the weather that we had to stay at home. 天气太冷，我们只好呆在家里。
> 2. Light travels so fast that we can hardly imagine its speed -> So fastdoes light travel that we can hardly imagine its speed.  光速很快，我们几乎没法想像它的速度。
> 3. The attack was so sudden that we had no time to escape -> So suddenwas the attack that we had no time to escape. 袭击来得非常突然，我们来不及逃跑。
>
> **总结：** 此类型的原句就是so...that (如此.. 以至于..)

(四) so+助动词+主语”倒装当要表示前面提出的某一肯定的情况也同样适合于后者
> You are young and so am I. (你年轻，我也年轻)  注意： 不能省略and, so am I 是一个句子，需要连接
> She likes music and so do I. (她喜欢音乐，我也喜欢）
> If he can do it,so can I. (要是他能做此事，我也能) 注意“逗号”的使用， 条件从句
> **若前面提出某一否定的情况，要表示后者也属于同样的否定情况，则应将其中的so改为neither或nor**
> You aren't young and neither am I. (你不年轻，我也不年轻)
> She hasn’t read it and nor have I. (她没有读它，我也没有读)
> **注意该结构与表示强调或同意的“so+主语+特殊动词”结构的区别, 此种情况不需要倒装**
> A: "It was cold yesterday.(昨天很冷)"  B: "So it was. (的确很冷)"
> A: "Father, you promised.(爸爸，你答应过的)" B: "Well,so I did. （嗯，是答应过）"
> **注意： so + adj/adv 基本可以互换such a/an + adj + n, such开头的也要倒装，但是互换有时会改变表达情感**

（五） 由not only…but also引出的倒装当not only…but also位于句首引出句子时，not only 后的句子通常用部分倒装形式， **but also 后面正常语序**
> Not only is he a teacher, but also he is a poet. (他不仅是一位教师，而且是一位诗人)
> Not only did he speak more correctly, but also he spoke more easily. (不仅他讲得更正确，也讲得更不费劲了)
>
> **注意：** not only .. but also 中but also不一定非要连在一起，也可以只留but或只留also ： Not only is he a teacher, but he is also a poet (这样写更舒服地道)

(六) 虚拟条件句的省略与倒装
**当if引导的虚拟条件从句中含有had, were, should等时，如将if省略，则要将had, were, should等移到主语前，构成倒装句**
> If you had come yesterday, you would have seen him. -> Had you come yesterday, you would have seen him.
> If you should require anything give me a ring. -> Should you require anything give me a ring.
> If it were not for your help,I would still be homeless. -> Were it not for your help, I would still be homeless.  (要不是你帮助，我会仍然无家可归)
> **省略if后提前的had不一定是助动词**
> If I had money, I would buy it. -> Had I money, I would buy it. (此处的had是实意动词)

（七） As 引导的让步状语从句倒装
**as作“虽然”解，引导让步状语从句时，必须将表语、状语或动词原形提到as前面。此时应注意几点：**
1. 若提前的表语是没有形容词修饰的单数可数名词，要省略不定冠词；
2. 若提前的是动词原形(多为不及物动词)，与之连用的通常是may, might, will, would等，且这些词都要保留在原来的位置上(主语后)；
3. though有时也可像as这样使作倒装， although绝对不能倒装**

> Tired（形容词） as I was, I tried to help them. 虽然我很累，我还是努力帮助他们。 =Although I was tired, I tried to help them.
> Try（动词） as he would, he couldn't open the door. 他试过多次了, 却仍打不开那门。 =Although he would try, he couldn't open the door.
> Search(动词） as they would, they would find nobody in the house. 无论怎样搜查，他们在房子里仍然没有找到一个人。 =Although they would search, they would find nobody in the house.
> Hard(副词） as (though) they tried, they couldn’t make her change her mind. 尽管他们做了很大努力，却没法让她改变主意。 =Although they tried hard, they couldn't make her change her mind.
> Boy(名词无冠词） as he was, he behaved like a girl. 他虽是个男孩，但举止却像个女孩。 =Although he was a boy, he behaved like a girl.

#### 状语从句
**状语主要是用来修饰动词和形容词的，以表明动作发生或状态存在的时间、地点、原因、目的、结果等。状语从句即指在主从复合句中用作状语的从句。状语从句主要用来修饰主句或主句的谓语**
（一） **时间状语从句**
*时间状语从句用表示时间的连词连接一个句子作状语，这样的主从复合句就是时间状语从句, 常用引导词：when, as, while, as soon as, before, after, since , till, until*
1. 由when,while, as引导的时间状语从句的区别用法
> + **when引导的从句的谓语动词可以是延续性的动词，又可以是瞬时动词, 并且when有时表示“就在那时”**
> When she came in, I stopped eating.她进来时，我在吃饭。(瞬时动词) [came in 此时是瞬间动词， 她进来我有注意到她，吃饭停了一下]
> When I lived in the countryside, I used to carry some water for him.当我的住在农村时，我常常为他担水。（延续性的动词） [live in 是延续性动词，一直在住着]
> We were about to leave when he came in.我们就要离开，就在那时他进来了。（就在那时）  
> **总结：** when 引导的从句有激活主句的感觉，从句的内容要平行并列主句.
>
> + **While引导的从句的谓语动作必须是延续性的，并强调主句和从句的动作同时发生（或者相对应）。并且while有时还可以表示对比**
> My wife was reading the newspaper, while I was watching TV. 我妻子在看报纸，我在看电视。(was reading是延续性的动词，并且was reading和was watching同时发生)
> I like playing football while you like playing basketball.我喜欢踢足球，而你喜欢打篮球。 (此处表示对比)
> **总结：** while后面始终要加延续性动词
>
> + **As表示“一边……一边”，as引导的动作是延续性的动作，一般用于主句和从句动作同时发生；as也可以强调“一先一后。**
> We always sing as we walk.我们总是边走边唱。（as表示“一边……一边”） [这里强调我们持续这样很长时间，像是一辈子的习惯]
> As we was going out, it began to snow. 当我们出门时，开始下雪了。（as强调句中两个动作紧接着先后发生，而不强调开始下雪的特定时间）
> **总结：** as表示的持续性甚至是一种习惯
>
> **Note:** 主从复合句，要强调的东西在前面写，这也是英文的的使用习惯，强调的东西始终放在第一位 .

2. 由before和after引导的时间状语从句的区别用法
> + **before引导的从句不再用否定式的谓语，并且当before引导的从句位于主句之后，有时译成“就，才”或“ 还没来得及... 就”。还要注意主句和从句之间的时间关系。当主句用将来时，从句总是用现在时；如果before引导的从句谓语用的是过去时，则主句动词多用过去完成时，这样以便体现动作发生的先后**
> It will be four days before they come back. （主将从现，一一对应） (他们要过四天才能回来)
> Einstein almost knocked me down before he saw me. （几乎同时发生） (爱因斯坦几乎把我撞倒才看到我)
> My father had left for Canada just before the letter arrived. （主过完从过） (我父亲恰好在信到之前去加拿大了)
> **leave for smw** (离开去某地)
> They had not been married four months before they were divorced. (他们结婚还不到四个月就离婚了)
>
> + **after表示主句动作发生在从句动作之后。主句和从句的动作的时间关系正好与before引导的从句相反**
> After you think it over, please let me know what you decide. (你仔细考虑过以后，告诉我你是怎样决定的)
> After we had finished the work, we went home. (完成工作之后，我们回家了) （从句用过去完成时，主句用一般过去时）

3. till或until引导的时间状语从句的区别
> + **till和until一般情况下两者可以互换，但是在强调句型中多用until,但是注意注意注意：①如果主句中的谓语动词是瞬时动词时，必须用否定形式；②如果主句中的谓语动词是延续性动词时，用肯定或否定形式都可以，但表达的意思不同。③till不可以用在句首，而until可以放在句首。**
> I didn't go to bed until（till）my father came back. (直到我父亲回来我才上床睡觉。)
> It was not until the meeting was over that he began to teach me English. (直到散会之后他才开始教我英语)
> I worked until he came back.我工作到他回来为止。（前肯意为否）
> I didn't work until he came back.他回来我这才开始工作。（前否意为肯）
> Please wait until I arrived.在我到达之前请等我。

4. since引导的时间状语从句的用法
> + **since引导的从句的谓语动词可以是延续性的动词，又可以是瞬时动词。一般情况下，从句谓语动词用一般过去时，而主句的谓语动词用现在完成时。但在It is ＋时间＋since从句的句型中，主句多用一般现在时**
> I have been in Beijing since you left. （主现完从过去） (自从你离开以来，我一直在北京了)
> Where have you been since I last saw you? （主现完从过去） (自上次我和你见面以后，你到哪里去了？)
> It is four years since my sister lived in Beijing. (我妹妹不在北京住有四年了)（今日重点句型，表示相反意思）

5. 在时间状语从句中
> + **当主句是一般将来时或祈使句表示将来的意义时，时间状语从句用一般现在时**
> I’ll let him know as soon as she comes.（主将从现） (她一来，我就会让你知道)

（二） **原因状语从句**
**用表示原因的连词连接一个句子作状语，这样的主从复合句就是原因状语从句，原因状语从句通常由because, since, as,for 引导**

| 项目   |  位置 |  内涵  | 语气| 能否回答why |
| :-- | :--------| :------|:------|:------|
| because(因为)   | 主句前或者后，通常放在后面为好 | 直接因果关系，或一些不太想说的原因 |强|能|
| as(由于)   | 主句前或者后 | 双方都知道的原因|弱|不能|
| since/now that (既然)  | 主语前 | 双方都知道原因 |弱|不能|
| for (因为)   | 句中，通常由逗号隔开 | 补充说明原因或推断的依据 |弱|不能|

> 1. because表示直接原因，语气最强。Because引导的原因状语从句多放在主句之后。回答由why提出的问题，只能用because。
> I was absent from the meeting because I was ill.
> 2. as和since语气较弱，一般用来表示明显的原因,即众所周知或当事人都知道，由as和since引导的原因状语从句多放在句首
> As it is raining, we will not go to the park.   (PS:下雨就在眼前，都知道)
> Now that/ Since everybody is here, let’s begin our meeting.
> 3. for有时也可引出表示原因的分句，但它只能位于后面，对前一分句加以解释或推断
> It must have rained last night, for the ground is wet．

(三) **目的状语从句**
**用表示目的的连词连接一个句子作状语，这样的主从复合句就是目的状语从句，目的状语从句通常由so that, in order to , in case, for fear **
> 1. I hired a boat so that I could go fishing. (我租了一条船去钓鱼)
> 2. Take your raincoat in case it rains (should rain). (带上雨衣以防下雨)
> 3. He studied hard in order that he could pass the exam. (他努力学习是为了能通过考试)
>
> **注意： in case 和 for fear 的区别：** in case 指“假如某种情况出现,我们要……” 同时发生的可能性非常大不可避免,for fear指“我们要……以免某种情况出现”,前者强调主语的能动性
> + He worked hard for fear that he might be fired by the boss (他拼命地干活惟恐被老板解雇)
> + He walked fast for fear that he should be late. (他快走,以免迟到)
>
> **注意： so that既可引导目的状语从句，又可引导结果状语从句。区别这两种从句的办法有两个**
> + 目的状语从句里往往带有情态动词can, could, may, might等,从意思上看，目的状语从句往往表示的目的很明确
> Speak clearly so that they may understand you. (目的状语从句)
> Jack is badly ill so that he has to rest. (结果状语从句)

（四） **条件状语从句**
**用表示条件的连词连接一个句子作状语，这样的主从复合句就是条件状语从句，引导条件状语从句的从属连词主要有if, unless，as long as, 激活条件**
1. Don't come unless I telephone (除非我打电话，否则你别来)
2. If you watch carefully you will **see how to do it (如果你仔细看，你会看出该怎样做)
3. I’ll help you with your English if I am free tomorrow (如果我明天有空，我就帮你辅导英语)
4. He won’t be late unless he is ill (除非他病了，否则他不会迟到)
> **注意：**
> + 祈使句连词要在中间
> + 在条件状语从句里，谓语动词通常用现在时态表示将来的动作或状态（主将从现），但是条件是不可能发生或实现的就是虚拟语气了，“If I were you ”

（五） **结果状语从句**
**引导结果状语从句的从属连词主要有so that, so…that，such…that等**
1. 在由so...that引导的结果状语从句中，so是副词，与形容词连用。其结构是: “...so + 形容词（副词）+ that + 从句
> + The hall is so big that it can hold 2,000 people  (这个大厅大得能容纳2000人)
> + Mother lives so far away that we hardly ever see her (妈妈住得太远了我们都无法常见面)
> + He shut the window with such force that the glass broke (他关窗子用力太大，玻璃都震破了)

2. 在由such…that引导的结果状语从句中，such是形容词，它修饰的可以是单数或复数可数名词，也可以是不可数名词；名词前面可以带形容词，也可不带。如果是单数可数名词，前面需加不定冠词a或an
> + It was such a hot day that nobody wanted to do anything (天太热了，没人愿意干活)
> + He made such rapid progress that he did very well in the mid-term. (他进步很快，期中表现非常好)

3. 如果名词前由many, much, little, few等词修饰时，只能用so, 不用such, 即“多多少少只能用so”
> + Soon there were so many deer(单复数一样) that they ate up all the wild roses (很快就聚集了许多鹿，啃光了所有的野玫瑰)
> + He has so little time that he can’t go to the cinema with you (他几乎没时间跟你们去电影院)

4. so...that...句型的否定形式可用简单句too...to...或not...enough to代替
> + He is so young that he can’t go to school = He is too young to go to school

5. 当so/such…that结构中的so或such放在句首时，主句用倒装语序
> + So proud was he that he never listened to any advice (他太骄傲了以致于从来听不进任何建议)

(六) **让步状语从句**

| 项目   |  位置 |  注意事项 |
| :-- | :--------| :------|
| though   |句首,或句末| 放在句末，做副词，意为“可是，不过” ,不可与but连用，可与yet,still连用|
| even though   | 通常放在句中链接主从句||
| even if  | 通常放在句中链接主从句 ||
| although  | 句首或句中 | 在句首需要有逗号，在句中不需要逗号，不可与but连用，可与yet,still连用 |

1. 引导让步状语从句的从属连词主要有although, though, even though，even if（即使）
> + Though we are poor, we are still happy. 我们虽然穷，但是很快活。
> + He went out even though it was raining. 尽管下着雨，他还是出去了。
> + It's hard work, I enjoy it though. 工作很辛苦，可我乐意干
> + The speech is good, it could be better though. 这次演讲不错，虽然还可以再好一点
> + Although Princeton has a world famous university, it is still a small quiet town. 普林斯顿虽然有一所闻名世界的大学，但仍然是个安静的小镇。
> + He often helps me with my English although he is pretty busy. 尽管他相当忙，但还是常常帮助我学英语。
> + Although the book was old , we decided to buy it . 尽管这本书很旧，我们还是决定买。
> + *Though she was busy with her work, yet she managed to find time to stay with her family 虽然她忙于工作,但她还是挤出时间与家人在一起.*
> + *She was busy with her work ,and yet she managed to find time to stay with her family (这里是副词and yet ==but )*
> + *She was busy with her work , yet she managed to find time to stay with her family （这里是连接词,解释为：虽然,但是=but ）*

2. 连词while有时也可表示“尽管”、“虽然”，引导让步状语从句
> While we don't agree with each other, we continue to be friends. 尽管我们意见不同，我们还是朋友

3. whatever, whoever, however, whenever, wherever等引导让步状语从句, 歌词中多见
> + Don't lose heart whatever you do. 不管你做什么，都不要灰心。
> + Whoever you are, you can't pass this way. 不管你是谁，你都不能从这里通过

4. as也可引导让步状语从句，但要将名词、形容词或副词等提到as前，若提前的是单数可数名词，要省略a或an，引导让步状语从句
> Teacher as he is, he can't know everything. 虽然是老师，他也不可能什么都懂。

5. Though引导的让步状语从句可用部分倒装，倒装后位于句首的名词之前不用冠词a或an
> Poor though I am ,I can afford it. 我虽穷，但这东西还是买得起的。

6. 习语 as though (好像，仿佛)，even though (即使，纵然)， 有一种虚拟在里面, 不确定是否是某种情况
> She closed her eyes as though she were tired. 她闭上眼，仿佛很疲劳似的。
> He is an honest man, I must say, even though I has opposed him. 尽管我反对他，我还得说他是个诚实的人。

(七) 地点状语从句
**注意区分where引导的定语从句与状语从句**
> 1. You’d better make a mark where you have any questions. (状语从句)你最好在有疑问的地方做个记号。
> 2. You’d better make a mark at the place where you have any questions. (定语从句) 你最好在有疑问的地方做个记号。

1. Where引导状语从句—副词性从句
**当Where引导状语从句时，Where前没有表示地点的先行词，Where是从属连词，Where引导的从句修饰主句的谓语动词**
> + The famous scientist grew up where he was born and in 1930 he came to Shanghai. (这位知名的科学家就在出生地成长，1930年来到上海。)
> 评析：句中“the famous scientist grew up "这一部分是该句的主句，Where到句子最后是地点状语从句，where前没有表示地点的先行词.
> +  She found her passport where she lost it . (她在她丢护照的地方找到了护照。)
> 评析："passport"是主句 found 后的宾语，它并不是从句中lost的地点，因此 where 引导的是地点状语从句，从属连词where引导的从句修饰主句的谓语动词 found 。

2. Where引导定语从句—形容词性从句
**当where 引导定语从句时，Where前有表示地点的先行词，where 引导的从句修饰先行词，Where是关系副词，在从句中作地点状语**
> + He's got himself into a dangerous situation where is likely to lose control over the plane . (他在飞机上失去控制，处于极其危险的境地。)
> 评析：situation 是先行词，其后是Where引导的定语从句。
> + This is the place where Luxun once lived . (这是鲁迅曾经生活过的地方。)
> 评析： the place 是先行词，其后是 where引导的定语从句 ，where 在从句中作地点状语。

3. 在有些情况下,where引导的定语从句可转换为where引导的地点状语从句.
> A tall building was put up at the place where there used to be a desert.＝A tall building was put up where there used to be a desert. (在以前曾是沙漠的地方盖起了一幢高楼.)

4. where引导宾语从句、表语从句、主语从句———名词性从句
> + This is where Luxun once lived.   这是鲁迅曾经住的地方(where 引导表语从句)
> + I don't know where Luxun once lived .我不清楚鲁迅曾经住在哪里。(where 引导宾语从句)
> + She was free to go to where she liked . 她可以去任何她喜欢的地方。(where 引导宾语从句)
> + Where Mary was born is Beijing .  玛利出身的地方是北京。(where 引导主语从句)

5. 学后感
> + 先行词是地点类的名词 place situation case， 后面的where引导定语从句
> + where 出现在什么地方就是充当什么成分
> + 主句动词后面除了宾语和表语，剩下的就是状语
> + 状语用来修饰的是主句的动词

6. 课后习题
> + 有志者事竟成。 Where there is a will, there is a way.   
> + 书在你原来放的地方。  The book is where you left it.   
> + 她回到了她刚才坐的地方。  She is back to where she sat just now.
> + 请呆在原处。  Please stay where you are.   
> + 这就是他曾工作过的农场。  This is the farm where he once worked.

（八） 比较状语从句
**常见的引导词有： as…as,not so (as)…as, than, the more…the more等**
1. **the more + 主谓， the more + 名词 + 主谓**
> + The harder you work, the more progress you will make. 你越努力，取得的进步就越大。   
> + The more you study, the more knowledge you can get.  你学的知识越多，你的知识越丰富。

2. **not so/as ... as 之间只能是形容词原级，不可以是比较级和最高级**
> + The work is not so difficult as you imagine. 这工作不像你想像的那么困难。
> + He doesn't work as hard as she (does). 他工作不像她那样努力。

3. **表示倍数的三种句型**
> + **倍数＋as many +可数名词复数+as**
> + **倍数+as much+不可数名词+as**
> + **倍数+as+形容词原级+名词+as**
> + I have twice as many books as you do. 我拥有的书是你的两倍。
> + It is reported that the United States uses twice as much energy as the whole of Europe. 据报道美国人使用的能源是整个欧洲的两倍。
> + I can rent three times as big a room as yours in my city using that money. 用那些钱我能在我们的城市租一个三倍大的房间。
> + **注意：** adj + a/an + 名词

（九） 方式状语从句
**常见的引导词有：as ,as if ，as though**
1. ** as if 从句用陈述语气的情况,当说话者认为句子所述的是真实的或极有可能发生或存在的事实时 **
> + It sounds as if it is raining．听起来像是在下雨。
> + He talks as if he is drunk．从他谈话的样子来看他是醉了。

2. **as if 从句用虚拟语气的情况,当说话人认为句子所述的是不真实的或极少有可能发生或存在的情况时。从句虚拟语气动词时态的形式如下**
> **如果从句表示与现在事实相反，谓语动词用一般过去时**
> + You look as if you didn’t care． 你看上去好像并不在乎。
> + He talks as if he knew where she was． 他说话的样子，好像他知道她在哪里似的。
> **从句表示与过去事实相反，谓语动词用“had＋过去分词”**
> + He talks about Rome as if he had been there before． 他说起罗马来好像他以前去过罗马似的。
> + The girllistened as if she had been turned to stone． 那女孩倾听着，一动也不动，像已经变成了石头似的。
> **从句表示与将来事实相反，谓语动词用“would／could／might＋动词原形”**
> + He opened his mouth as if he would say something．  他张开嘴好像要说什么。
> + It looks as if it might snow．看来好像要下雪了。
> **注意：** as if /though引导的从句常用虚拟语气，表示非真实情况，但如果从句中陈述的情况很可能实现，也可用陈述语气

（十） 状语从句的省略
**当时间、条件、让步、方式和比较状语从句的主语与主句一致或为it 或 there且谓语动词含be动词时，从句中的主语和谓语可以一起省去**
1. Don’t speak until spoken to.( 省略了you are) 你不要讲话，除非让你讲话。
2. I have no money. If any, I will lend yousome. 我手里没有钱，有的话，我会借给你的。( 省略了there is)
3. Though cold, he still wore a shirt. 尽管很冷，他却只穿一件短袖。 ( 省略了it was)

#### 强调句
（一） 区分强调句与其他类型从句（主、定、状）
1. 强调句与主语从句的区别
> + It is true that he is honest. (主语从句) 他真的很诚实。
> + True he is honest (去掉It is ... that 之后不成句子，所以是主语从句，强调句去掉仍然成句子如： It is Mr Fu that is honest)
> + It is known to all that China is a country with a long history. (主语从句) 众所周知，中国是一个历史悠久的国家。
> It was here that he fell off his bicycle.(强调句) 这正是他从自行车上摔下来的地方。
> **总结：** “It is / was + 形容词 / 分词 /  + that从句”是主语从句，它译成中文时**不**可加上“正是……”“就是……”之类字眼，

2. 含有定语从句的强调句型 (在被强调的名词后再设计一个以该名词为先行词的定语从句，这时不要把定语从句当作强调句)。
> + It was this school where (in which) he once studied that gave him a chance of teaching.正是这所他曾经学习过的学校给了他教学的机会。
> **总结：** 这种句子先写主干： It was this school.... that gave him a chance of teaching

3. 强调句型与状语从句的区别
> + It was at 7:00 that I arrived.(强调句型，强调时间状语at 7:00)正是在7:00时， 我到了。
> + It was 7:00 when I arrived.(时间状语从句，在7:00前无介词at) 当我到达时， 时间是7:00。
